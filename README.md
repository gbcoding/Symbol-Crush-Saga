This program will randomly initialize your game board using a set of 6 
characters (!, \", #, $, %, &) that a player will then attempt to create 
combinations of 3 or more matching characters. Players will have 10 moves
to find as many matches as possible.

To run:
 - Clone Repository
 - Compile source file using your C++ compiler of choice
 - Run executable and follow directions
 
 - You will enter the coordinates of the spot on the board
	 where you see a match, then enter the direction of the match.
	 Should you find you've run out of matches, entering R0 will
	 reshuffle the board. Good luck!
